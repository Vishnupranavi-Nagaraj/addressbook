# addressbook  -MVC application



                                                   AddressBook-Application

1)Only authenticated users can access the address book application

2)Address book should list all the addresses in alphabetical order of name. This should be the initial landing page when I visit an address book (https://d1wli5mq9yq9mw.cloudfront.net/static/images/sample_address_book.png). The link is just a reference. You can follow a design of your own. Should list (Name, address, and phone number on the list page)

    There should be an add option on the list address page which should redirect to the page where I can add a new address. Once I successfully add a new address, the page should redirect to the address list page (http://www.sourcecodester.com/sites/default/files/images/maverickosama/My_Address_Book.JPG). The link is just a reference. The add address should have the following fields

    a) Name - Text Field
    b) Age - Dropdown
    c) Address - TextArea
    d) Phone number - Textbox
    e) Country - Dropdown
    f) State - Dropdown
    g) City - Textbox

    Should have an edit button on each record listed on the address list page. This edit button should redirect to a page where I can edit the existing address book details

    Should have a multiple check option and delete the addresses on the address list page (similar to select and delete multiple emails in any mailbox. i.e. should have a check-box)
